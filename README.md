The first contract is used to accept Ether  and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees, thus allowing Human Resources to pay employees quickly, efficiently, and productively. 
The second contract is used to distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For instance, the CEO gets the most, the CTO gets the second most, and Bob gets the least amount. Anything that remains is given to the CEO.
